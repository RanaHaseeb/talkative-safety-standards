      <p>Welcome to Talkative. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Talkative mobile application and associated services (collectively, the "Service"). By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Who may use the Service</h2>
      <p>The Service is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. By using the Service you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are under 18, do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Account and anonymous usernames</h2>
      <p>Talkative generates anonymous usernames when users open the app. You may optionally link your account to a third-party account (e.g., Gmail) by explicit consent. You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account or username.</p>

      <h2>3. Prohibited conduct</h2>
      <p>When using the Service you must not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post, transmit, or solicit child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any sexual content involving minors.</li>
        <li>Use the Service to harass, stalk, intimidate, or threaten others.</li>
        <li>Impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
        <li>Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or any content that may harm the Service or its users.</li>
        <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Reporting and enforcement</h2>
      <p>We provide in-app reporting tools for users to flag content or behavior that may violate these Terms, including suspected CSAM or exploitation. Reports are reviewed by our safety team and may be escalated to law enforcement when required. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts and remove content that violates these Terms.</p>

      <h2>5. Content ownership and license</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of the content you post. By posting content to the Service you grant Talkative a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, modify, and display that content for the purpose of operating and improving the Service.</p>

      <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your use of the Service is subject to our <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/458aed5d-cb4a-49d0-a295-39db0ae331ef">Privacy Policy</a>. The Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information, and should be read together with these Terms.</p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available". To the fullest extent permitted by law, Talkative disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Talkative, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from your use of the Service.</p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Talkative and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, illegal, or for any other reason.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the developer operates, without regard to conflict of law principles. If you are located in a jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws that differ, those laws may apply to you.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms with a revised "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

      <h2>13. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Terms or child safety compliance, contact us at <a href="mailto:ranahaseeb33@gmail.com">ranahaseeb33@gmail.com</a>.</p>
